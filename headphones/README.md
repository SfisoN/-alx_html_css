Welcome! This project is based on a Figma design that you'll need to duplicate to your drafts to access all design details. This README will guide you through the setup, design specifics, and implementation notes to ensure a smooth development process.

🌟 Getting Started

1. Accessing the Figma Design

Create a Figma account (if you don't have one yet).

Open this Figma project (insert your Figma link here).

Click on "Duplicate to your Drafts" to have full access to the design files.

Alternative access: If you encounter any issues accessing the design file, you can download it directly here: Figma File Download (insert your alternative download link).

🖋️ Design Setup

Fonts Required

Please ensure you have the following fonts installed on your system:

Source Sans Pro

Spin Cycle OT (please provide the font file if it's not publicly available)

If these fonts are not installed, you may experience discrepancies in design rendering.

Design Notes

Some element sizes in Figma are provided as floating-point values. Feel free to round these values to the nearest integer for practical implementation.

Stick closely to the design for best results, but small rounding adjustments are acceptable.

🌐 Responsive Design Specifications

The web page must automatically switch to the mobile version when the viewport width is 480px or less.

Ensure proper responsiveness across devices and browsers.

✨ Interactions & Styling

Hover/Active States:

Links: #FF6565 on hover and active states.

Buttons: Set opacity: 0.9 on hover and active states.

Layout Constraint:

The content container must have a maximum width of 1000px and be centered horizontally on the page.

🎓 Development Recommendations

Use semantic HTML and clean, maintainable CSS.

Consider using a CSS framework (like TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, etc.) if appropriate for your stack.

Follow accessibility best practices.

Ensure cross-browser compatibility.

🚀 Deployment

Once development is complete:

Test responsiveness on various devices.

Verify hover and active interactions.

Validate font rendering.

✨ Summary

By following this guide and closely adhering to the Figma design, you'll deliver a polished, responsive, and accessible web page that reflects the intended design vision.

Happy coding! 🚀
